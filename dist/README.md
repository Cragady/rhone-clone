# HTML/CSS CHALLENGE FROM RHONE

Please recreate this email using HTML/CSS to put it on a web page that is responsive. We like to use media queries at 768px for tablet devices and 425px for mobile devices. Please do not use bootstrap, we want to see your css knowledge. After you are done, host it on github, share the hosted link and share your github repo so we can review. We would like you to get us the links to your challenge before Tuesday of next week (06/04/19) so our team can review and decide if we want to bring you in for an interview as soon as possible.
